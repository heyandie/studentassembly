            p
              | Corruption is most commonly defined as&nbsp;
              strong the misuse or abuse of entrusted power for private gain
              |. It has various forms that we can divide into two categories: quiet corruption and hard corruption.&nbsp;
              strong Quiet corruption
              | &nbsp;occurs when power holders fail to perform their jobs properly without suffering any consequences. For example, a professor regularly not attending class or a school administrator often missing required sessions.&nbsp;
              strong Hard corruption
              | &nbsp;occurs when power holders abuse their power and commit illegal acts for private gain. For example, when a professor bribes a student or asks for sexual favors.
            p Corruption occurs in universities because students arenâ€™t empowered to report while schools want to keep their reputation. Student Assembly tackles this double barrier- it provides a safe anonymous reporting platform for students and an efficient report management platform for school administrations.
